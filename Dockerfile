# than a default baked into the code so a customer can still point a pod somewhere else.

# Pre-installed so a pod does not spend roughly three minutes in pip on every boot.
# This is a cache warm and nothing else: the launcher still installs each node pack's
# own requirements on the pod at runtime, so no behaviour depends on a package being
# present here, and anything that would not install cleanly was dropped rather than
# forced. See the header of custom-node-requirements.txt for what was left out and why.
#
# The constraints file is the load-bearing part. Several of those requirements pin numpy
# and two ask for torch unpinned; resolving either here would pull a CPU torch over the
# base image's 2.10.0+cu128, and ComfyUI would then fail to start on every pod built
# from this image. So: capture what the base image already has, install against it, and
# refuse to produce an image where torch moved. The expected version is read back out of
# the constraints file rather than written here, so the check cannot drift from the pin.
#
# Placed above the COPY of launcher/ and catalog/ deliberately - those change on almost
# every commit, and this layer is the expensive one to rebuild.

# dlib is built here so that no customer's pod ever builds it.
#
# It is the only requirement across all twelve pinned node packs with no wheel at all:
# dlib 20.0.1 ships one file on PyPI, dlib-20.0.1.tar.gz, and every install is a CMake
# C++ compile. ComfyUI_FaceAnalysis asks for it, ComfyUI_FaceAnalysis is in the
# dataset-generator workflow, and that is a rented GPU spending its minutes on a
# single-threaded compile of a CPU library. Once, on a build machine, is the right
# number of times.
#
# custom-node-requirements.txt above deliberately excludes it: that file installs
# unpinned and wheels-only, and a source build does not belong in it. This is the
# same package, pinned, with the toolchain it needs, and verified immediately after.
#
# The cmake wheel carries its own binaries, so apt is only touched when the base image
# turns out to have no C++ compiler - and then only for as long as the build takes.
#
# Build parallelism is capped at 4 on purpose, and it is the difference between a layer
# that publishes and a layer that does not. Unpinned, this build ran one job per core and
# GCC 13.3.0 died with an internal compiler error in try_forward_edges (cfgcleanup.cc:580)
# compiling dlib/svm/structural_svm_problem_threaded.h - once in two attempts on a 32-core,
# 31 GiB builder. Thirty-two concurrent cc1plus on headers that template-expand like dlib's
# SVM code is roughly a gigabyte of peak resident set each; "there is lots of RAM" and
# "no job is short of RAM" are not the same claim, and an intermittent failure on the layer
# that gates image publishing is not something to leave to chance. Four jobs is slower and
# it finishes.
